/*
Ram is developing a restaurant management system using the following modules:

1. An interface RestDetails with a variable consisting of the restaurant name and a getMenu(String choice) method to take the user input for the different food items to be ordered.
2. Abstract class Order with an abstract function as getInvoice which will generate the total invoice amount and its discounted amount based on the food itemâ€™s ordered, if the amount exceeds 2000, apply discount of 20% and a constructor to take the user input for the food order such as Sandwich, Chinese, Pizza,etc.    
3. A class known as RestMgmt inherits the interface and Abstract Class to display the choices made, food items selected and the invoice generated
